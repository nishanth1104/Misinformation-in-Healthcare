# 🧠 NLP Final Project – Claim Verification with Machine Learning

Welcome to the repository for my **NLP Final Project**, where I built a robust pipeline to verify the **veracity of claims** using a blend of traditional machine learning models and modern NLP techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In a world flooded with information, being able to **detect false or misleading claims** is more important than ever. This project tackles this challenge using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various classification models.

📝 **Notebook:** [NLP_Final (3).ipynb](NLP_Final%20(3).ipynb)  
🔍 **Goal:** Automatically classify claims as `True`, `False`, `Mixture`, or `Fabricated`.

## 💡 Key Insights

- **TF-IDF + SVM** provided a great trade-off between accuracy and speed.
- Class imbalance was a critical challenge and was mitigated using smart preprocessing.
- The models can generalize well to unseen claims with minimal overfitting.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Add lightweight transformer models like **TinyBERT** for improved semantic understanding.
- Deploy as an interactive **AI agent** or **web app**.
- Integrate with **n8n** and **Google Sheets** for automated tracking and logging.
